## Hi everyone!

I'm Philip, and I like to program. I currently attend UVA, and plan to graduate within the next year or two. My interests include operating systems, cryptocurrency, and autonomous systems.

### Notable Projects

- 🪙 A blockchain using Rust, featuring custom mining mechanics, fast merkel tree implementations, incoming support of mining pools, and a web-based UI.
- 🤖 Hoohacks 2025 (Virginia's biggest hackathon) winning entry, a web application + LLM based search engine for finding hotels using entirely natural language inputs.
- 🏎️ Fast and effective LiDAR segmentation algorithm using ROS2 C++ that was tested on both solid state and 360 degree mechanical spinning lidars on ground vehicles.
- 📈 A black scholes whiskey trading engine (updates coming soon!) achieving low latency using ring buffers, template metaprogramming, and SIMD vectorization.
